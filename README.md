# Level-2-Capstone-Project-3-2022

# *1. The Purpose*

The purpose of the project is to create a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a specific data set and present the findings by means of tables and visualisations

# *2. The Data*

The data that's analysed is for a [Student Performance Data Set](https://github.com/Chris-github01/Level-2-Capstone-Project-3-2022/blob/main/student_data.csv). The following data is given in the data set:

  * school
  * sex
  * address
  * famsize
  * Pstatus
  * Medu
  * Fedu
  * Mjob
  * Fjob
  * absences
  * G1
  * G2
  * G3

# *3. Data Analysis*

The Exploratory Data Analysis is broken down into the following sections:

  * Introduction
  * Data cleaning
  * Missing data
  * Data stories and visualisations

Each section listed above will be discussed below

## 3.1 Introduction
 
The introduction mentions that the EDA is an analysis of an automobile data set and that a number of questions will be answered by means of tables and visualisations.
 
## 3.2 Data cleaning
 
On inspection, the data contains '?' which needs to be replaced with 'NAN'. The replace() function is used to "clean" the data
 
## 3.3 Missing data
 
In this section the data set is checked for missing data. In this EDA it is done in list form, table form and as a visualisation. Functions are then used to replace 
the missing data with the appropriated  mean values 
 
## 3.4 Data stories and visualisations
 
In this section of the [Exploratory Data Analysis](), we extract stories and assumptions based on visualizations of the data set. The analysis is broken down into the 
following sections:

 * Gender analysis
 * Mother's job title (Mjob) analysis
 * Father’s job title (Fjob) analysis
 * Final grade vs Absences
 * Grade vs Age
 * Parents occupation WordClouds
 * Parents' Job vs Education levels

### 3.4.1 Gender analysis

The percentage of students divided by gender is determined and displayed

### 3.4.2 Mother's job title (Mjob) analysis

In this section we will look at the different job titles for Mothers.

### 3.4.3 Father’s job title (Fjob) analysis

In this section we will look at the different job titles for Fathers. 

### 3.4.4 Final grade vs Absences

In this section we will check if student absences have an effect on their final grades.

### 3.4.5 Grade vs Age

In this section we will compare the grades to the ages of the students. 

### 3.4.6 Parents occupation WordClouds

A WordCloud of the occupations of the parents is generated.

### Parents' Job vs Education levels

Here we will compare the Parents' Job to their Education levels.

# *4. Results*

After analysing the data, a detailed report with [results]() is made.
